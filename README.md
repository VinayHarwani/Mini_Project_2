# Gravit Jump
Created a site to understand how gravitational force works on different planets/bodies.<br/>
We have a input box where user can enter dfferen values for graviational force.<br/>

<br/>User can click on apply buton to apply that gravity.<br/>
After applying an info box will appear that explains that gravitational force and its range.<br/>

<br/>A planet is given with a ball that will show effect on jump on that planet with the provided gravitational force.<br/>
A jump button is provided , after clicking jump we can see the effects of that gravitational force.<br/>
