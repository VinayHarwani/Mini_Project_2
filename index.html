        <input type="number" placeholder="Gravity Value" class="gb">
        <button class="apply" onclick="apply()">Apply</button>
        <button class="jump" onclick="jump()">Jump</button>

        <p class="p0">Enter gravity value on top right , apply it and click Jump.</p>

        <p class="p1"><span class="sl1">Gravitational force between 0g and 0.48g works like we are in outer space.</span><br/>
            <span class="sl2">means that if you were to jump on this planet you will never touch the surface again.</span><br/>
            <span class="sl3">Asteroid , one of the largest asteroid in our system has gravitational force of 0.27g.</span> </p>

        <p class="p2">Gravitational force between 0.49g and 1.6g can be found on our dwarf planet Pluto.<br/>
            If you were to jump on Pluto you will reach a maximum height of 7.6m.<br/>
            But don't worry you will fall very slowly from that height.</p>

        <p class="p3">Gravitational force between 1.7g and 3.6g can be found on our Moon.<br/>
            If you were to jump on Moon you will reach a maximum height of 2.7m.<br/>
            Jumping on Moon must be so fun.</p>

        <p class="p4">Gravitational force between 3.7g and 8.7g can be found on Mercury , Mars or planets of that size.<br/>
            If you were to jump on those planets you will reach a maximum height of 1.2m.<br/>
            Its equivalent to double jump on Earth.</p>

        <p class="p5">Gravitational force between 8.8g and 15g can be found on Earth , Venus , Saturn , Uranus and Neptune.<br/>
            If you were to jump on those planets you will reach a maximum height of 0.6m.<br/>
            Its amazing to think that all those planets with varying sizes has almost equal Gravitational Force.</p>

        <p class="p6">In our solar system the difference of size of Jupiter and other planet is so high that,<br/>
            we don't have any planet which has gravitational force range between them.<br/>
            But if we were to put another planet of size between them such that its gravitational Force ranges between 15 to 20,<br/>
            then upon jumping we will reach a maximum height of 0.4m.</p>

        <p class="p7">Gravitational force between 20g to 30g can be found on planets like Jupiter.<br/>
            You cannot jump on those planets, but if you managed to jump you will reach a height of 0.2m.</p>

        <p class="p8"><span class="s1">Gravitational force more than 30g is so large that you cannot even try to jump.</span><br/>
            <span class="s2">Our sun has Gravitational force of 293g.</span><br/>
            <span class="s3">Don't try to jump there.</span></p>
